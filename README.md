## Testimonials

> "You've been an asset to the team Pavan. I've always maintained that you have the ability to do extremely good analysis. When we had the objective of implementing data gateways for 150 bots in a quarter, the scale required multiple people to be involved in the implementation and with that we always needed the ability to correct mistakes at the database level. I didn't even have to think twice on who would be best suited to manage this complexity."
